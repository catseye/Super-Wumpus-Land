Super Wumpus Land
=================

This is the reference distribution of Super Wumpus Land, a computer game
by Chris Pressey, based on a legendary game by Gregory Yob.

It contains original version of Super Wumpus Land, written as a Perl
script, in the `scripts` directory.

It also contains a conversion in Javascript, for playing in a web browser,
in the `impl/swl.js` directory.  This implementation uses modules from
`yoob.js` to simulate the terminal in an HTML5 canvas.
